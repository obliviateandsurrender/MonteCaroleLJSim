# Monte Carlo for LJ particles:

Monte Carlo code for system of LJ particles 

## Features:

1. Code implements Periodic boundary conditions and minimum image convention
2. NVT simulation: computes the pressure given N, V and T using average of virial
3. NpT simulation: computes the density given N, pressure and T.

## To run the file:

```
python3  <input_filename>.py
Provide the option, <nvt> or <npt>
```
